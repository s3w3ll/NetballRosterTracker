# **App Name**: Netball Court Time Tracker

## Core Features:

- Team Roster Management: Upload, store, and manage team rosters, retrievable from the server.
- Game Setup: Set up a game with selected players, define the number of periods (quarters), and period duration.
- Position Assignment: Assign players to standard netball positions (GS, GA, WA, C, WD, GD, GK), with options to customize position names and numbers.
- Real-time Tracking: Track each player's time on the court and time in each position in real-time.
- Substitution Management: Drag-and-drop interface for easy player substitutions, moving players between the bench and court positions.
- Match Planning: Create pre-defined match plans with player positions for each quarter to view simulated game time for each player and position.
- Match Data Storage: Save the on-the-fly game and match plan game data for future references. The application allows pushing local data to remote data when internet connection becomes available.
- Tournament Play: Manage multiple games within a tournament and consolidate player time across all matches and positions. This stores each goal for both team against each player's goal number.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6), almost white, but clearly of the same hue as the primary.
- Accent color: Violet (#7E57C2) for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a modern, readable, and slightly friendly feel.
- Clear and simple icons to represent positions, actions, and data points.
- A clean, card-based layout to present data in an organized manner. Prioritize usability with large, touch-friendly elements, and always available data persistence with action requests for cloud save.
- Smooth transitions for player substitutions and clock actions, subtle animations for game events like goals.
